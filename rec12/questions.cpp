15. Which statement about recursion is true?
    A. Recursive functions are always faster than iterative ones.
    B. Recursive functions must include a base case to prevent infinite recursion.
    C. Recursive functions cannot return values.
    D. Recursion can only be used for numeric problems.

true/false
